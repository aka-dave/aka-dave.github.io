        <div class="valid-right">

         
         
          <p>In this project I built an image gallery that was based on the card game Yu-Gi-Oh. The image gallery has multiple layouts which are user friendly and also has multiple interactivity options. For example part of the layout is hooked to an API that generates a Yu-Gi-Oh card which takes the card name as an input and displays that card to the screen on the user end. There is also a form to fill out based on the cards presented to the screen but at the moment, it doesn't sumbit as I am still working on the backend of this application.</p>

      <div class="valid-right">

       
        <p> In this project I built a dog image viewer that filters the images displayed based on what breed is chosen from a list of breeds. The name of the breeds are extracted from a dog api to form a select element of all the breeds. Once the user selects the breed, a request is made to the API to get a random image of that breed which is then scripted to display directly under the select box. Animations were also created to signal to the user that the image hasn't loaded yet since this is an asynchronous process.</p>

    <div class="valid-right">
      <p> The task for this project was to build an online calculator which had both the functionality as well as the proper user interface. This was a fun project I was doing at the online bootcamp where I first introduced to the interactivity that JavaScript creates to web applications. They were uncovered edge cases that were brought to my awareness after testing the application.  </p>

<h2> Sum of digits project</h2>
<h3> <a href="https://github.com/aka-dave/aka-dave.github.io/blob/main/Python%20Projects/SumOfDigitsOfEqualSumAlgorithm.py">  View project  </a> </h3>

      <img src="images/SumOfDigitsRes.jpg" alt="">


    </div>
    <div class="valid-right">
      <p>In this project I had to create a data structure solution that returns the sum of the biggest pair of integers whose sum are equal. For example, given an array of [25, 52, 41], the output should
        return 77 since 25 and 52 are 1 pair. If the array has no pairs then it return -1. This project was interestingly challenging to me as I needed to think in a way I have not before. I had to use nested arrays to keep track of the positioning of specific elements. The project was complete in Python programming language. </p>

          </div>
          <div class="valid-right">
            <p> This was an object orientated based project where I built a cache system that ensured every entry is unique. It took multiple inputs such as 'add', 'get', 'has', 'remove', 'reset'. Those were to be written as functions. Each line of input was separated by a pipe symbol in such a way where it performs that operation to the cache system. </p>

          <img src="images/Valid-sub-stringRes2.jpg" alt="">


        </div>
        <div class="valid-right">
          <p> For this project I built a solution to data structure problem involving password verfication. The criteria was that for a string S consisting of numbers and/or uppercase and lowercase letters, return the biggest substring that is valid. A valid substring for this case was one that contains atleast one uppercase charactr and no numbers. The solution to this problem became clearer when I thought of it being split into three segments: the initial condition, end condition and everything that happens inbetween. </p>
